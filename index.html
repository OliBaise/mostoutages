    <h1>Which ISPs Have the Most Outages?</h1>

    <p>Nothing’s more frustrating than having your internet down. So we analyzed traffic to pages related to troubleshooting internet outages from 26 leading US home broadband providers to find out which ISPs have the most outages.</p>

    <h2>Exactly What We Did</h2>

    <p>To find out how many customer reported outages each ISP had, we used organic traffic measurement tool Ahrefs to look at:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The amount of monthly traffic that each provider’s outage support page had each month.</li>
      <li>The amount of traffic that each ISP’s Downdetector (a website dedicated to tracking internet outages) page had each month.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We then added these monthly traffic figures together and multiplied them by 12 to get the number of people trying to troubleshoot internet outages for each provider per year.</p>

    <p>We then found the latest figures on each ISP’s home wifi customer base and divided the number of outage related queries by each customer base to find out the number of outage related searches per customer per year for each broadband provider.</p>

    <p>You can see a full breakdown of our sources at the end of this article.</p>

    <h2>Which ISP Has The Most Outages?</h2>
<ul>
   <li> <p>AT&amp;T has the highest number of outages, with 423.83 outage related complaints for every 1,000 customers.</p></li>

 <li>   <p>Verizon and T-Mobile have the second and third most outages, with 349.49 and 317 outage related complaints for every 1,000 customers respectively.</p></li>

  <li>  <p>Breezeline was the worst small provider, with 299.07 outage related complaints for every 1,000 customers.</p></li>

  <li>  <p>TDS is the ISP with the fewest outages. TDS only has 24.37 outage complaints for every 1,000 customers.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>You can see a table with our full findings for 26 home fiber providers below:</p>

    <h2>Which ISP Has Most Outages In Your State?</h2>

    <p>We combined the above data with Google Trends state by state comparison of ISP outage related queries to see who is the most reliable and unreliable ISP in each state.</p>

    <p>You can see the results below:</p>
